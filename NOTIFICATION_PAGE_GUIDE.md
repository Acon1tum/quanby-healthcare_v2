- Priority badges (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT) with color coding
- Type badges showing the notification category
- Relative timestamps ("2 minutes ago", "1 hour ago", etc.)
- Visual indicators for unread notifications

### 5. **Pagination**
- 20 notifications per page (configurable)

- Adaptive UI for tablets and desktops
- Touch-friendly action buttons
- Smooth animations and transitions

## üõ£Ô∏è Routes

The notification page is accessible at the following routes based on user role:

```typescript
// Patient
/patient/notifications

// Doctor
/doctor/notifications

// Admin
/admin/notifications

// Super Admin
/super-admin/notifications
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Component Structure

```
notification.component.ts       - Main component logic
notification.component.html     - Template with filters and list
notification.component.scss     - Beautiful styling
```

### Key Dependencies

```typescript
- NotificationService          // Handles API calls and WebSocket events
- WebSocketService            // Manages Socket.IO connection
- AuthService                 // Provides user authentication
- Router                      // Handles navigation
```

### Real-Time Flow

```
1. User logs in
   ‚Üì
2. WebSocketService connects with JWT token
   ‚Üì
3. NotificationService sets up event listeners
   ‚Üì
4. Backend emits notification events
   ‚Üì
5. NotificationService updates BehaviorSubjects
   ‚Üì
6. NotificationComponent automatically re-renders
```

## üì° WebSocket Events

The component listens to these real-time events:

| Event | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `notification:new` | New notification created | Add to list, show browser notification |
| `notification:unread-count` | Count changes | Update badge |
| `notification:refresh` | Bulk changes | Reload entire list |
| `notification:updated` | Notification marked as read | Update specific item |
| `notification:deleted` | Notification deleted | Remove from list |

## üé® UI Components

### Header Section
- Page title "Notifications"
- Unread count badge
- "Mark All as Read" button (shown when unread > 0)

### Filters Section
- Three filter buttons: All, Unread, Read
- Each shows the count of notifications in that category
- Active filter highlighted with gradient

### Notifications List
- Card-based layout
- Unread items highlighted with blue background
- Each card shows:
  - Type emoji icon
  - Title and message
  - Timestamp
  - Priority and type badges
  - Action buttons (mark as unread, archive, delete)
  - Pulsing blue dot for unread items

### Empty State
- Bell icon
- "No notifications" message
- Contextual text based on current filter

### Pagination
- Previous/Next buttons
- Current page and total pages
- Total items count

## üíÖ Styling Features

- **Modern Gradients**: Blue for primary actions, green for "mark all as read"
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects, transitions, pulse animations
- **Color Coding**:
  - LOW priority: Gray
  - NORMAL priority: Blue
  - HIGH priority: Orange
  - URGENT priority: Red
- **Responsive Breakpoints**:
  - Desktop: Full width with all features
  - Tablet: Adjusted spacing and layout
  - Mobile: Stacked layout, full-width buttons

## üîí Security

- **Protected Routes**: All notification routes require authentication
- **Role-Based Access**: Each role has its own notification route
- **User-Specific Data**: Backend only returns notifications for the authenticated user
- **JWT Authentication**: WebSocket connection secured with JWT token

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Accessing the Page

Users can access their notifications by:
1. Clicking the notification bell icon in the header (if navigation is added)
2. Directly navigating to their role-specific route (e.g., `/patient/notifications`)

### Common Actions

**View All Notifications:**
```
1. Navigate to /[role]/notifications
2. Default view shows all notifications
```

**Filter Unread:**
```
1. Click "Unread" filter button
2. View only unread notifications
```

**Mark as Read:**
```
1. Click on any notification card
2. Notification marked as read
3. Redirects to action URL if available
```

**Bulk Mark as Read:**
```
1. Click "Mark All as Read" button in header
2. All notifications marked as read instantly
```

**Delete Notification:**
```
1. Click trash icon on notification card
2. Confirm deletion
3. Notification removed immediately
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Login as different roles** (patient, doctor, admin)
2. **Navigate to notifications page**
3. **Verify initial load** - Notifications should appear
4. **Test filters** - Click each filter and verify results
5. **Test real-time updates**:
   - Open two browser tabs
   - Trigger a notification in one tab
   - Verify it appears instantly in both tabs
6. **Test actions**:
   - Mark as read
   - Mark as unread
   - Archive
   - Delete
   - Mark all as read
7. **Test pagination** - If more than 20 notifications exist
8. **Test responsive design** - Resize browser to mobile/tablet sizes

### Triggering Test Notifications

Create appointments, prescriptions, or lab results to trigger notifications:

```bash
# From backend
POST /api/appointments
POST /api/prescriptions
POST /api/lab-requests
```

Or use the test endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/notifications/test
{
  "title": "Test Notification",
  "message": "This is a test",
  "type": "GENERAL",
  "priority": "NORMAL"
}
```

## üéØ Integration Points

### Header Notification Bell
The header already has a notification dropdown. You can add a "View All" link:

```html
<!-- In header.component.html -->
<a [routerLink]="'/' + currentUser.role.toLowerCase() + '/notifications'" 
   class="view-all-link">
  View All Notifications
</a>
```

### Dashboard Widgets
Add a notification widget to dashboards:

```html
<div class="notification-widget">
  <h3>Recent Notifications</h3>
  <div *ngFor="let notification of notifications | slice:0:5">
    <!-- Display notification summary -->
  </div>
  <a [routerLink]="'/' + role + '/notifications'">View All</a>
</div>
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques Used

1. **Pagination**: Only loads 20 notifications at a time
2. **Subscription Management**: Properly unsubscribes on component destroy
3. **WebSocket Fallback**: Polls every 60 seconds as backup
4. **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side filtering for instant results
5. **OnPush Strategy**: Could be added for even better performance

### Best Practices

- Keep notification count reasonable (archive old ones)
- Use appropriate priority levels
- Provide meaningful titles and messages
- Set relevant action URLs for navigation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing

1. **Check backend**: Ensure notifications are being created
2. **Check WebSocket**: Open browser console, look for connection logs
3. **Check authentication**: Verify user is logged in with valid token
4. **Check route**: Ensure correct role-based route

### Real-Time Not Working

1. **Check WebSocket connection**: Should see "Connected to Socket.IO server" in console
2. **Check CORS**: Ensure backend allows WebSocket connections
3. **Check port**: WebSocket server should be on port 8081
4. **Fallback**: Even if WebSocket fails, polling will work (60s interval)

### Styling Issues

1. **Check Tailwind**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured
2. **Check SCSS**: Verify SCSS compilation is working
3. **Check browser**: Clear cache and hard refresh

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Notification Preferences**: Let users choose which notifications to receive
2. **Email Notifications**: Send important notifications via email
3. **Sound Effects**: Play sounds for new notifications
4. **Categories**: Group notifications by category
5. **Search**: Search notifications by title/message
6. **Export**: Export notification history
7. **Batch Actions**: Select multiple notifications for bulk actions
8. **Snooze**: Temporarily hide notifications
